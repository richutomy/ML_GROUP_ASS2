        "Social media proves to be a medium for the users to get details more easily and also understand multiple perspectives about different products and benefits(Kang, 2018). As a result of the data  shared through social media can affect a potential consumer’s decision to make a purchase. Social media promotes interaction, coordination as well as sharing of content (Palmer & Koenig-Lewis, 2009). This can be through blogs, social network platforms as well as review websites. Such sites can also be used to promote brands like Pinterest. The information that is shared in the Internet about different views of customers about products can be utilised by firms to evaluate the general feedback of the customers to further improve their offerings and more over ensure a higher customer satisfaction.\n",

        "In this project, we aim to utilise the data available on social media to understand the general opinion of users about a product that would assist the vendor to further iterate their product. As part of this assignment, sentimental analysis would be used to understand the general trends in social media. Sentimental analysis can be defined as the procedure of computationally recognising and classifying feedbacks that is usually elaborated through text in order to identify the attitude of the writer as either 'positive', 'negative' or 'neutral'.  Thus the business problem statement of this project is as follows:\n",

The data from Twitter is considered because the information is easily accessible when compared to other social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram.
